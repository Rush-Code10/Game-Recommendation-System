# Game-Recommendation-System
I developed a content-based game recommendation system leveraging Python and machine learning techniques. Processed and analysed game data to generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences and game features. And by using ML techniques such as text vectorization and cosine similarity, I got the top N similar games.

There are also some files along with the DATA SET from here:
1. Here's the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset 
2. For Glove embedding here's the file: https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
3. There's a modif.csv file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GpUCdsHE2WOmWYqWVx6COyAoOyX9eqyE/view?usp=sharing

Run the code on Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
